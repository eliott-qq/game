# Description

Welcome to our text-based Memory Game written in C++

The Memory Game is a cognitive challenge designed to test and enhance memory retention skills. Players are tasked with locating matching pairs of fruits from an array, requiring concentration and recall abilities. It is suitable for participants of all ages and promotes focus, strategy, mental agility, and–of course–enjoyment. 

All pairs of fruits are initially covered and shuffled thoroughly, where each matching pair is distributed randomly. Players can start by ‘flipping’ a pair; if the fruits match, a point is given. If not, the player must remember the location of the fruits as they will be covered again. The game is not simply just a test of lucky guesses–rather of logical reasoning. Developed with various difficulty levels, each with their own countdowns, the objective of the game is to identify all pairs of fruits as quickly as possible. Even better?! Players also have the ability to customize their gameplay with the ‘custom function.’ 

With endless possible combinations, can you remember it all?
